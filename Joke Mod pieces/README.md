I did not make the Joke Mod, I did extract out a few features I like and compile them seperately as mods here.

The mods listed in this folder are not published on the web and only used in a private server, "thebrainserver"

Part of the reason is the pets piece, and the other reason is this IP is not my work, just an edit of the orignal author


these mods are not currently working
